		<!-- <h1>Rock Against Ocean</h1> -->
		<!-- <p>Is an image that represents our relationship with feelings and serves as an illustration for it.
  The rock can either be firm against the ocean waves or carried by them, the same way that we can
  be carried by our emotions or stay firm despite them. It is not about choosing one of these options,
  but recognizing the huge influence of feelings and emotions over our wishes, memories, dreams and thoughts.
